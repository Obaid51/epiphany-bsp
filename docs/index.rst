Welcome to Epiphany BSP's documentation!
========================================

This documentation provides an introduction to each component of the
Epiphany BSP (EBSP) library. Each section introduces a number of new EBSP functions
which we call *primitives* through an example. At the end of each section the
new primitives are summarized and detailed documentation is provided for them. Finally,
we also provide a complete reference of the API and a short introduction to the formal BSP model.
